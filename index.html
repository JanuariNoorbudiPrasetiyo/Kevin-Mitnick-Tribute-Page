                <li>Kevin Mitnick (KnowBe4’s Chief Hacking Officer) and KnowBe4’s CEO Stu Sjouwerman worked for 8 months
                    to distill Kevin’s 30+ years first-hand hacking experience into online training modules for
                    employees in an office environment.</li><br>
                <li>This is the highly successful Kevin Mitnick Security Awareness Training which ensures that employees
                    are properly trained to deal with frequent hacking attacks and can spot social engineering red
                    flags.</li><br>
                <li>Based on Kevin Mitnick’s 30+ year unique first-hand hacking experience, you now can train employees
                    to better manage the urgent IT security problems of social engineering, spear phishing and
                    ransomware attacks.</li><br>
                <li>Kevin David Mitnick, 59, died peacefully on Sunday, July 16, 2023, after valiantly battling
                    pancreatic cancer for more than a year. Kevin is survived by his beloved wife, Kimberley Mitnick,
                    who remained by his side throughout their 14-month ordeal. Kimberley is pregnant with their first
                    child. Kevin was ecstatic about this new chapter in his and Kimberley's life together, which has now
                    been sadly cut short.</li><br>

            <p class="tribute-quote">“I was addicted to hacking, more for the intellectual challenge, the curiosity, the
                seduction of adventure; not for stealing, or causing damage or writing computer viruses.” <br><br> --
